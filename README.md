# LEARNING C++
This is my very first modular program in C++, It's soon time to get into audio software creation!
I did this very quickly with the aim of moving on to bigger things. I consider it a success.

### Goals with this exercise:
* Win conditions
* Checks for illegal moves
* Modular setup with a header file
